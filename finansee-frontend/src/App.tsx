  // TODO: Design how the debt and upcoming bills systems will work
  // Questions to ponder:
  // - How to log debts? How will it integrate with the upcoming bills system?
  // - How to schedule upcoming bills? (recurring vs once vs custom dates)
  // - How to mark a debt or upcoming bill as paid? Through the tracker or in their systems?
  // - Do we automate the logging of debts and upcoming bills when entries are added or modified on their systems, or let users manually input them in the tracker?
  // - How do we handle deletion of debts/upcoming bills? They have to be able to be deleted with or without logs being written due to various circumstances
